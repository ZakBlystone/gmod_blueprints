CLASS Angle, angle, PN_Angles
{
	FUNC SHARED Add
	{
		DESC Adds the values of the argument angle to the orignal angle. This functions the same as angle1 + angle2 without creating a new angle object, skipping object construction and garbage collection.
		IN angle, PN_Angles, #The angle to add.
	}
	FUNC SHARED Div
	{
		DESC Divides all values of the original angle by a scalar. This functions the same as angle1 / num without creating a new angle object, skipping object construction and garbage collection.
		IN scalar, PN_Number, #The number to divide by.
	}
	PURE SHARED Forward
	{
		DESC Returns a normal vector facing in the direction that the angle points.
		OUT forward, PN_Vector, #The forward direction of the angle
	}
	PURE SHARED IsZero
	{
		DESC Returns whether the pitch, yaw and roll are 0 or not.
		OUT isZero, PN_Bool, #Whether the pitch, yaw and roll are 0 or not.
	}
	FUNC SHARED Mul
	{
		DESC Multiplies a scalar to all the values of the orignal angle. This functions the same as num * angle without creating a new angle object, skipping object construction and garbage collection.
		IN scalar, PN_Number, #The number to multiply.
	}
	FUNC SHARED Normalize
	{
		DESC Normalizes the angles by applying a module with 360 to pitch, yaw and roll.
	}
	PURE SHARED Right
	{
		DESC Returns a normal vector facing in the direction that points right relative to the angle's direction.
		OUT right, PN_Vector, #The right direction of the angle
	}
	FUNC SHARED RotateAroundAxis
	{
		DESC Rotates the angle around the specified axis by the specified degrees.
		IN axis, PN_Vector, #The axis to rotate around.
		IN rotation, PN_Number, #The degrees to rotate around the specified axis.
	}
	FUNC SHARED Set
	{
		DESC Copies pitch, yaw and roll from the second angle to the first.
		IN originalAngle, PN_Angles, #The angle to copy the values from.
	}
	FUNC SHARED SetUnpacked
	{
		DESC Sets the p, y, and r of the angle.
		IN p, PN_Number
		IN y, PN_Number
		IN r, PN_Number
	}
	PURE SHARED SnapTo
	{
		DESC Snaps the angle to nearest interval of degrees.
		IN axis, PN_String, #The component/axis to snap. Can be either "p"/"pitch", "y"/"yaw" or "r"/"roll".
		IN target, PN_Number, #The target angle snap interval
		OUT snapped, PN_Angles, #The snapped angle.
	}
	FUNC SHARED Sub
	{
		DESC Subtracts the values of the argument angle to the orignal angle. This functions the same as angle1 - angle2 without creating a new angle object, skipping object construction and garbage collection.
		IN angle, PN_Angles, #The angle to subtract.
	}
	PURE SHARED Unpack
	{
		DESC Unpacks the angle
		OUT pitch, PN_Number
		OUT yaw, PN_Number
		OUT roll, PN_Number
		CODE #1, #2, #3 = $1.p, $1.y, $1.r
		COMPACT false
	}
	PURE SHARED Up
	{
		DESC Returns a normal vector facing in the direction that points up relative to the angle's direction.
		OUT up, PN_Vector, #The up direction of the angle.
	}
	FUNC SHARED Zero
	{
		DESC Sets pitch, yaw and roll to 0. This function is faster than doing it manually.
