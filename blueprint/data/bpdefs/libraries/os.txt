	FUNC SHARED clock
	{
		DESC Returns the approximate cpu time the application ran.
		OUT clock, PN_Number, #runtime

	FUNC SHARED date
	{
		DESC Returns the date/time as a formatted string or in a table.
		IN format, PN_String, #The format string. If this is equal to '*t' or '!*t' then this function will return a DateData structure, otherwise it will return a string. If this starts with an '!', the returned data will use the UTC timezone rather than the local timezone. See http://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man3/strftime.3.asp for available format flags. BUG	 Not all flags are available on all operating systems and the result of using an invalid flag is undefined. This currently crashes the game on Windows. Most or all flags are available on OS X and Linux but considerably fewer are available on Windows. See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fe06s4ak.aspx for a list of available flags on Windows. Note that the # flags also crashes the game on Windows. Issue Tracker: #329
