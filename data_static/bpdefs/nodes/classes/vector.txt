		OUT length, PN_Number, #Length of the vector in two dimensions, √ x² + y² 
	}

	FUNC Normalize, SHARED
	{
		DESC Normalizes the given vector. This changes the vector you call it on, if you want to return a normalized copy without affecting the original, use Vector:GetNormalized.
	}
	FUNC Rotate, SHARED

		DESC Rotates a vector by the given angle. Doesn't return anything, but rather changes the original vector.
		IN rotation, PN_Angles, #The angle to rotate the vector by.

		IN x, PN_Number
		IN y, PN_Number
		IN z, PN_Number

	FUNC Sub, SHARED
	{

		OUT color, PN_Color, PNF_None, #The created Color structure.
	}
	FUNC ToScreen, CLIENT
	{
		DESC Returns where on the screen the specified position vector would appear. A related function is gui.ScreenToVector, which converts a 2D coordinate to a 3D direction.
